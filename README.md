# Tortoise-and-Hare-Race-
One of the most complex programs I have made in my college career. This simulates a race between X tortoises and Y hares. This uses an Animal calls and Tortoise and Hare child classes, by enheritance. <br/>
Language: Java <br/>
Date Completed: May 1st, 2014 <br/>
## Instructions
Go through the prompts, adding the amount of tortoises and hare you would like in that race. If the total animals you put in the race is over 20, then you will be prompted again till the number of total animals entered is 20 or lower. After that the race begins with the blue animals of your choosing racing to the finish line on the right. The program stops, but does not close, when an animal crosses the finish line.
